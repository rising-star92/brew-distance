Brew-Distance
=============

A Python module that implements a weighted edit distance algorithm. In
simple terms, it compares two strings and determines the number of edits
required to make the first the same as the second, typically for use
when weighing multiple potentially similar strings in a data set.

This is a mostly faithful remake of
`Perl's Text::Brew <https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Brew>`_ implementation,
except "INITIAL" matches aren't reported in output, since that isn't
generally meaningful. (And, of course, it's written in a Pythonic idiom.)

This module isn't intended to be the most efficient determiner of edit
distance; rather, it's concerned with simply offering this algorithm
in pure Python, which provides not just edit distance, but the edit
steps taken to determine it. It also allows each edit type
("MATCH", "DEL", "INS", "SUBST") to be re-weighted, one of its main
points of difference. This implementation is useful for cases where
real-time performance is not a consideration, but re-weighting edit
types or the post-processing evaluation of edit steps is a requirement.
(Also, as it's a simple, pure Python implementation, it could be easily
customized, and it could be used as a sample implementation for
educational purposes.) (`See also`_.)

Installing and uninstalling
---------------------------

The easiest way to install is using pip:

::

    pip install brew-distance

Alternatively you can clone this git repo and install using
setuptools:

::

    git clone git@github.com:dhgutteridge/brew-distance.git
    cd brew-distance
    python setup.py install

To uninstall with pip:

::

    pip uninstall brew-distance

Usage
-----

Interface
~~~~~~~~~

::

    function distance(string1, string2, output='both', cost=[0, 1, 1, 1])
        Determine the weighted edit distance between two strings.

        string1 is the string to be transformed.

        string2 is the transformation target.

        Optional output is a string containing "distance", "edits", or
        "both", which determine results output, see below.

        Optional cost is a four element array of numbers used to adjust
        the costs of matches, insertions, deletions, and substitutions.
        (It is not recommended that match costs be adjusted: the algorithm
        is predicated on match having a lower cost than other operations.)

        The results vary depending on the output option:
            "distance": provides the edit distance as a number.
            "edits": provides an array with the list of edit actions.
            "both: provides a tuple containing the output of both
            previous options.

    class BrewDistanceException(builtins.Exception)
        Brew-Distance-specific exception used with argument validation.

Example
~~~~~~~

::

    import brew_distance

    try:
        print("Determining results for 'four' vs. 'foo':")
        print(str(brew_distance.distance("four", "foo", "both")))
    except brew_distance.BrewDistanceException as error:
        print(str(error))

Notes
~~~~~

Character comparisons are case-sensitive.

There are no special considerations concerning the relatedness of
various Unicode characters, e.g. a German Eszett (double-S) character
is not considered equivalent to two S characters. Characters are dealt
with as raw code points, without any semantic weighting. Such
processing would require extension by the end user.

Under Python 2, all non-Unicode strings are converted to UTF-8 encoding
to try to ensure multi-byte characters are treated correctly.

Compatibility
-------------

Brew-Distance supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2+. It does not support
Python < 2.6, as it requires **namedtuple** from **collections**.

Alternate options
-----------------

There are many alternate options for edit distance calculations, perhaps
most notably `python-Levenshtein <https://github.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/>`_,
which offers far more features in general, except it does not
(at present) allow for re-weighting edit types.

Another project under development (at the time of writing) is
`weighted-levenshtein <https://github.com/infoscout/weighted-levenshtein/>`_,
which also offers re-weighting of edit types, but (as of version 0.2.1)
does not support Unicode, and isn't tested on as many Python releases.
However, it allows for re-weighting of individual characters, for more
fine-grained analysis, e.g. to flag typical typing transposition errors.

Credit is due to Chris Brew, who published a related implementation of
this algorithm (most commonly known as Wagner-Fischer). Also, mention
should be made of Dree Mistrut and Keith C. Ivey, who respectively
created and maintained the Perl Text::Brew implementation on which this
is based.

FAQs
----

*What motivated you to write this?*

I once had occasion to use the Perl
`Text::Brew <https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Brew>`_
implementation as part of a project to relate data from disparate systems.
I needed something that let me re-weight particular edits depending on
the context (e.g. two strings of unequal length that matched up to the
point the shorter one ended were considered a probable match if the
shorter one came from a legacy system that had limited text fields), and
Text::Brew fit the bill. I thought it would be nice to have a Python
version available too, in part because the Perl implementation didn't
support Unicode, and I was dealing with data in languages other than
English.

*Why license it under the GPL?*

Because the Perl implementation on which this was based was offered
either under the Perl Artistic License or the GPL. It didn't make sense
to me to offer Python code under the Perl Artistic Licence, so it seemed
appropriate in spirit to keep it GPL.
